
# Onscreen Display for Raspberry Pi

Sometimes you need to enter a E-Mail address, a password or configure the app in the admin center.
There are several ways to do this, but sometimes it is more convenient to have a onscreen keyboard.

There are several virtual keyboards available:

- onboard (preferred)
- florence or
- matchbox-keyboard

Install one of them:

```bash
# preferred:
sudo apt-get install onboard

# alternatives:
sudo apt-get install florence
sudo apt-get install matchbox-keyboard
```
