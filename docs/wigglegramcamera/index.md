# Wigglegram Camera [![current release](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/wigglecam)](https://pypi.org/project/wigglecam/)

Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle! 😜 There's so much more to your photobooth-app than you can imagine!
Starting from version 9, the photobooth-app has an incredible new feature: integration with [multicamera nodes to form a camera array](https://github.com/photobooth-app/wigglecam)!

The technique allows you to capture stunning photos using multiple cameras arranged in a camera array. The best part is that the captures are taken at the same time since the cameras are synchronized.

The result is an awesome short animated image that gives a stunning 3D effect! Just picture it! See yourself:
