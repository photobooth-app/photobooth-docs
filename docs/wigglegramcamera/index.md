# Wigglegram Camera

There is more to your photobooth! Starting from v5 the photobooth-app integrates with our new multicamera backend.
It allows to capture photos from several cameras at the same time to create 3d effect GIFs.

In this subsection, the build and setup of the wigglecam is described.

    This is all experimental! 🧪
