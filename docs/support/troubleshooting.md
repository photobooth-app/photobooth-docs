# Troubleshooting

## Photobooth app website not available

In default configuration the app listens to 0.0.0.0:8000,
so it can be reached from every computer in the same network on port 8000.

If the website is not available, the reason could be

- network issues or
- bad configuration

Check that the website is available on the device itself via <http://localhost:8000>.
If that works, the issue is about the network.

If not, the app might have crashed.

The following commands help tracking down issues and gather information:

```bash
# logfiles from service (last 200 lines)
journalctl --user --unit=photobooth-app -n 200 --no-pager
# logfiles created by photobooth
cat ~/photobooth-data/log/qbooth.log
# check CmaFree especially for Arducams if low:
cat /proc/meminfo
```

If service crashed ðŸ’€, kill the python process:

```bash
# check whether there is a process still running but not responsive:
ps ax | grep python3
# kill it
sudo pkill -9 python3
```

Manually start the photobooth-app and watch the terminal

```bash
photobooth 
#or
python -m photobooth
```

```text
INFO: The app uses current directory as data directory!
```

## Photobooth command not found

If there is a warning as following during pip installation and photobooth can't start check the PATH variable

```text
WARNING: The script photobooth is installed in '/home/pi/.local/bin' which is not on PATH.
Consider adding this directory to PATH or, if you prefer to suppress this warning, use --no-warn-script-location.
```

See following is fine, might just need a restart after installation because the path .local/bin did not exist before.

```sh  title="~/.profile"
# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists
if [ -d "$HOME/.local/bin" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
fi
```

## Gphoto2 camera found but no access

On a fresh Linux installation, there might be services running to detect cameras and allow for easy file transfer.
For the photobooth this needs to be disabled because the application needs access to the camera.

If you find errors in the log as below, read further.

```text
[    INFO] found camera - 0:  usb:001,009  Canon EOS 1100D (gphoto2.py:303)

[    INFO] (gp_port_set_error [gphoto2-port.c:1190]) Could not claim interface 0 (Success). Make sure no other program (gvfs-gphoto2-volume-monitor) or kernel module (such as sdc2xx, stv680, spca50x) is using the device and you have read/write access to the device. (port_log.py:89)

```

Check for running processes:

```bash
$ ps ax | grep gphoto2
1074 ?        Ssl    0:00 /usr/libexec/gvfs-gphoto2-volume-monitor
2785 ?        Sl     0:00 /usr/libexec/gvfsd-gphoto2 --spawner :1.7 /org/gtk/gvfs/exec_spaw/2
```

To disable the monitoring services, execute following commands:

```sh
systemctl --user stop gvfs-gphoto2-volume-monitor
systemctl --user disable gvfs-gphoto2-volume-monitor 

# after a reboot, the gvfs-gphoto2-volume-monitor will be enabled automatically again :(
# permanently disable:
sudo chmod -x /usr/lib/gvfs/gvfs-gphoto2-volume-monitor

reboot
```

After a restart there should be no process any more:

```bash
$ ps ax | grep gphoto2
# nothing to see here...
```
