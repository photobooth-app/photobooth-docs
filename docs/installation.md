## Reference Systems

These are systems used productive or in automated testing and guaranteed to work without issues.
Gphoto2 and the webcam backends support many different camera models but manufacturers might implement communication protocols slightly different.
If you run into issues, create an issue or open a discussion.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or later
- Camera, can be one or two (first camera for stills, second camera for live view)
    - DSLR: [gphoto2](https://github.com/gonzalo/gphoto2-updater) on Linux
    - Picamera2: installed and working (test with `libcamera-hello`)
    - Webcamera: no additional prerequisites, ensure camera is working using native system apps
- Raspberry Pi Bullseye for Picamera2 or any other linux/windows system
- Turbojpeg (via apt on linux, manually install on windows)
- [works probably best with 3d printed photobooth and parts listed in the BOM](https://github.com/mgrl/photobooth-3d)

The photobooth app can be used standalone but is not feature complete yet.
Anyway, it integrates well with the fully blown [photobooth project](https://photoboothproject.github.io/),
see description below how to achieve integration.

## Install on Linux (Debian/Ubuntu/RaspberryPi OS)

The app is available as [PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/photobooth-app/).
On a fresh Raspberry Pi OS 64bit, run following commands:

### Update System

```zsh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

### Install system dependencies

Following dependencies to be installed for Raspberry Pi OS 64bit Bullseye.
Adjust for debian/ubuntu. Picamera2 is only available on Raspberry Pi.

```zsh
# basic stuff
sudo apt-get -y install libturbojpeg0 python3-pip libgl1 libgphoto2-dev
# to display some nice icons and emoticons
sudo apt-get -y install fonts-noto-color-emoji
# to sync images online
sudo apt-get -y install rclone inotify-tools
# to use camera modules on rpi
sudo apt-get -y install python3-picamera2
```

### Tweak system settings

To use hardware input from keyboard or presenter, the current user needs to be added to tty and input group.
Replace {USERNAME} by actual username, for example pi.

```zsh
usermod --append --groups tty,input {USERNAME}
```

### Install photobooth app from PyPi

```zsh
pip install photobooth-app
```

### Create data folder

The photobooth-app automatically uses the current folder as data folder.
All images, logs and config files will be stored in this folder.

```zsh
mkdir ~/photobooth-data
cd ~/photobooth-data
```

### Start the app

```zsh
photobooth
```

Browse to <http://localhost:8000> and see if the app is working properly.
Per default the app uses a generated image and displays a timer only. No camera is started at this point.
You need to [continue setting up the cameras](./setup.md).

!!! info
    Have issues accessing the website or see error messages during installation and app startup? Check the [troubleshooting guide](./help/troubleshooting.md).

## Install on Windows

While using the app on windows works, there is no documentation yet.
Also use is limited by now, because the digicamcontrol software is not yet implemented.
Only webcams can be used on windows right now.

## Install development version

Stable releases are published at [PyPI registry](https://pypi.org/project/photobooth-app/) usually.
To test the latest development version install directly from git:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/mgrl/photobooth-app.git@dev
```
