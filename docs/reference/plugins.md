# Plugins

The photobooth-app backend can be extended by plugins since version 6.

!!! note
    This page is a guide and documentation on how to develop a plugin. The use of the included plugins is not decribed here but in the setup section.

    If you want to develop plugins you need python skills. The support to develop plugins is quite limited but feel free to ask questions in the Github discussions.

## Plugins Built-In

There are some plugins built in and can be used as reference to build your own plugins:

- [GPIO](https://github.com/photobooth-app/photobooth-app/tree/main/src/photobooth/plugins/gpio_lights) to control light
- [WLED](https://github.com/photobooth-app/photobooth-app/tree/main/src/photobooth/plugins/wled) signaling countdown, capture and recording
- [pilgram2 filter](https://github.com/photobooth-app/photobooth-app/tree/main/src/photobooth/plugins/filter_pilgram2) apply color filter in post processing
- [commander](https://github.com/photobooth-app/photobooth-app/tree/main/src/photobooth/plugins/commander) hook http requests and commands to events

## Plugin Architecture

Plugins listen to [event-hooks](https://github.com/photobooth-app/photobooth-app/blob/main/src/photobooth/plugins/__init__.py) triggered by the [pluggy](https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package.

```text title="Basic folder structure for a plugin" hl_lines="4-6"
- photobooth-data (working directory)
  - plugins
    - plugin_name              <-\
        - __init__.py (empty)     |   same name
        - plugin_name.py       <-/
        - config.py (optional)
```

### Available hooks

Plugins can register to hooks, so called [hookspecs](https://github.com/photobooth-app/photobooth-app/blob/main/src/photobooth/plugins/__init__.py). The hookspecs are categorized currently as follows:

- ``PluginManagementSpec``: Start and Stop the Plugin during app startup/shutdown
- ``PluginStatemachineSpec``: Hooks triggered during actions like countdown start, capture, finished, ...
- ``PluginAcquisitionSpec``: Hooks directly triggered by the backends when a capture is triggered and capture is done.
- ``PluginMediaprocessingSpec``: Hooks triggered for post processing images to apply filter.

## Plugin Skeleton

In this very basic example the plugin only prints to the console during app startup:

```python title="plugin_name.py"
import logging
from photobooth.plugins import hookimpl 
from photobooth.plugins.base_plugin import BasePlugin
from .config import PluginNameConfig    # if the plugin shall have a config, create the config.py file and import here

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__) # use to emit log messages

# NOTE: name the class following to the folder name -> plugin_name will require the class to be PluginName
class PluginName(BasePlugin[PluginNameConfig]):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

        # when this _config is present, the plugin manager detects it and adds the configuration to the admin dashboard
        self._config: PluginNameConfig = PluginNameConfig()

    @hookimpl # mark a function as hook implementation, check the hookspec for available hooks
    def start(self):
        if self._config.plugin_enabled:
            print("Message is printed when enabled in config!")
        else:
            print("Message is printed when not enabled in config!")
```

The configuration consists of a class and one bool variable to enable the plugin.

```python title="config.py"
from pydantic import Field
from pydantic_settings import SettingsConfigDict

from photobooth import CONFIG_PATH
from photobooth.services.config.baseconfig import BaseConfig

class PluginNameConfig(BaseConfig):
    # The plugin uses pydantic-settings to store settings.
    model_config = SettingsConfigDict(title="PluginName Config", json_file=f"{CONFIG_PATH}plugin_pluginname.json")

    plugin_enabled: bool = Field(
        default=False,
        description="Enable to start the plugin with app startup",
    )
    # ... add more configuration here...
```

## Filter Plugin Skeleton

The filters drawer can be extended by plugins since v6. Check following example for a basic understanding,
also have a look at the integrated pilgram2 filter for reference.

Most of the file below is boilerplate, the relevant functions to modify and hook your filter are `mp_filter_pipeline_step` and `do_filter`.

```python title="plugin_filter.py"
import logging
from typing import cast, get_args

from PIL import Image, ImageFilter

from photobooth.plugins import hookimpl
from photobooth.plugins.base_plugin import BaseFilter

from .config import FilterStableConfig, available_filter

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# NOTE: name the class following to the folder name -> plugin_filter will require the class to be PluginFilter
class PluginFilter(BaseFilter[FilterStableConfig]):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

        self._config: FilterStableConfig = FilterStableConfig()

    @hookimpl
    def mp_avail_filter(self) -> list[str]:
        return [self.unify(f) for f in get_args(available_filter)]

    @hookimpl
    def mp_userselectable_filter(self) -> list[str]:
        if self._config.add_userselectable_filter:
            return [self.unify(f) for f in self._config.userselectable_filter]
        else:
            return []

    @hookimpl
    def mp_filter_pipeline_step(self, image: Image.Image, plugin_filter: str, preview: bool) -> Image.Image | None:
        filter = self.deunify(plugin_filter)

        if filter:  # if anything, then filter, else for None this plugin is not requested, leave.
            return self.do_filter(image, cast(available_filter, filter))

    def do_filter(self, image: Image.Image, config_filter: available_filter) -> Image.Image:
        filter = getattr(ImageFilter, config_filter)
        filtered_image = image.filter(filter=filter)

        return filtered_image

```

The configuration consists of a class and one bool variable to enable the plugin.

```python title="config.py"
import typing

from pydantic import Field
from pydantic_settings import SettingsConfigDict

from photobooth import CONFIG_PATH
from photobooth.services.config.baseconfig import BaseConfig

available_filter = typing.Literal[
    "CONTOUR",
    "FIND_EDGES",
    "EMBOSS",
]


class FilterStableConfig(BaseConfig):
    model_config = SettingsConfigDict(title="Filter Plugin Config", json_file=f"{CONFIG_PATH}plugin_filter_example.json")

    add_userselectable_filter: bool = Field(
        default=True,
        description="Add userselectable filter to the list the user can choose from.",
    )
    userselectable_filter: list[available_filter] = Field(
        default=[f for f in typing.get_args(available_filter)],
        description="Select filter, the user can choose from. Even if unselected here, the filter is still available in the admin configuration.",
    )

    # ... add more configuration here...
```

## Publish Plugins

Functionality not tested yet.
Basically you can package the plugin and use the entry group 'photobooth.plugins' which is scanned during photobooth-app startup. If the plugin is detected, it will be used.
